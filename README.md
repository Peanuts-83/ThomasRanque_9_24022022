* [FRONT END  - APPLICATION & TESTS](https://github.com/Peanuts-83/Billed-app-FR-Front/)


## Project's presentation

After publishing cookbooks for several years, the company decided to embark on a new project: to create its own site of cooking recipes like Marmiton or 750g.
Front-end application requires back-end API to run. Please refer each documentation for setup.

## Process build in 3 steps:

* Plan 2 versions of the feature with a version using native loops (while, for...) and a version in functional programming with the methods of the array object (foreach, filter, map, reduce). An "algorigram" is required for each of the proposals.

* Implement both, using 2 different branches on Git so keep the separate code for each.

* Test each algorythm's performance (Jsben.ch) for this kind of analysis and choose the most efficient.

**A feature investigation sheet on the search algorithms must be provided.**
